# this folder contains example files for a DCAT-AP-NL profile for OGC API Records


On the wiki the pros and cons of the different structures is described: [OGC API Records and DCAT‐AP‐NL](https://github.com/Geonovum/DTaaS-Testbed2/wiki/OGC-API-Records-and-DCAT%E2%80%90AP%E2%80%90NL)

The folder 'classic_items' shows an example of a json result with nested dataset, distribution and dataservices.

The folder 'finegrained_items' shows an example of (several) json responses with separate results for dataset, distribution and dataservice.

The folder 'bag_example' shows a more complete example of the chosen approach, where distributions and dataservices are nested within the dataset result. This is the chosen scenario for the current Testbed2 results.
