# Introduction

With testbed 2 we want to stimulate further implementation of the architecture (visualisation, data, calculation interconnected with the fundament) to enable the realisation of a Dutch space for interoperable Digital Twin applications. This testbed focusses on adoption for known components and further research for additional components.  

The nLDT can only come to fruit if the multiple various Digital Twin initiatives can come together, forming a mathematical field. Only then can Digital Twins be part of the instrumentation that is used to tackle the complex and intricate issues in a densely populated country where activities come together on a limited area.

We want to intensify the testbed 1 architecture but also enable stakeholders new to the testbed to participate. We want to address the technical questions of this testbed in use cases with the intention to clarify user questions we have identified.

Geonovum, in line with its mission, is keen to get the answers; and it seeks to involve the market to do so. The actual questions and issues to be addressed are combined into four topics.

-	Topic #1: Foundation
-	Topic #2: Visualization
-	Topic #3: Data
-	Topic #4: Calculation models
