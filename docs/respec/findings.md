# Findings

Overall this testbed has demonstrated that a modular architecture with well defined interfaces can create an ecosystem where different parties can provide value. This stengthens the whole ecosystem, and is a clear example of how public-private interaction can be facilitated.

The lessons learned (as documented in the previous chapter) show a lot of progress. We also see a lot of room for improvement still!

Some topics that are brought up for further investigation are:

- Well defined profile for DCAT-AP(-NL) in relation to OGC API Records.
- Integration of OGC API Processes/Features with semantic standards to further improve understanding of the exchanged data.
- Puzzles to be solved in the interaction patterns of Federated Catalogs
- Value that AI can bring to this ecosystem
- Improve alignment of the nLDT architecture with general 'Interoperable Europe' architectures
- Research how Market places can provide value in a nLDT ecosystem
- Orchestration of calculation models
- Dynamic data / Sensordata integration into the nLDT ecosystem
- further GeoBIM integration
